# Directory Overview

This directory contains a collection of Zsh aliases for various development tools. The aliases are organized into separate files based on the tool they are for (e.g., `git-alias.zsh`, `docker-alias.zsh`).

# Key Files

*   `README.md`: Provides an overview of the aliases and instructions on how to use them.
*   `*.zsh`: These files contain the actual alias definitions. Each file is dedicated to a specific tool or set of tools.

# Usage

To use these aliases, you need to source the `.zsh` files in your `~/.zprofile` or `~/.zshrc` file. The `README.md` file provides a script to do this automatically.

The aliases are organized by tool. For example, to see the available Git aliases, you can look at the `git-alias.zsh` file or the `README.md` file.
